Originally forked to create a Super Mario birthday message for my 4 year old son in his birthday.  So I added many things.

## Things added:

1. Touch Screen Controls (Mouse Events and Super Mario Run like controls).
2. Coins and coin collection
3. Hid the collision boxes for presentation sake
4. Simplyfing the level layout specification.

## To be added beyond my son's birthday message requirements

1. Death and dying (life counter and game over screen)
2. Implement the functionality of the ? blocks (mr Persson calls these "chance")
3. Pipe mechanics. The underground mini level.
4. Piranha Plants.
5. Main Menu...?
6. Level Editor maybe..? someone help me!
